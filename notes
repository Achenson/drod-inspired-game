tailwind ccs && typescript:

1. npx create-react-app [name] -- typescript
2. npm i -D tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer
3. npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full (all settings will be visible) 
(for some reason has to be tailwind.js not tailwind.config.js!)
4. change tailwind.js name, so it won't work anymory, but all settings can be checked
5. npx tailwind init tailwind.js 
(this time without -- full flag -> in this file we will put only our custom settings)
6. postcss.config.js -> 

const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
module.exports = {
  plugins: [tailwindcss("./tailwind.js"), require("autoprefixer")],
};

7.  src/assets/main.css

    src/assets/tailwind.css
    @import "tailwindcss/base";
    @import "tailwindcss/components";
    @import "tailwindcss/utilities";

8. delete both .ccs file in root, delete react logo

9. package.json:

"start": "npm run watch:css && react-scripts start",
"build": "npm run build:css && react-scripts build",
   ...
"build:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css",
"watch:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css"

10. Tailwind css intelisense extension

11.  index.tsx 

    import './assets/main.css';

12. after every change in config file (tailwind.js) run npm run build:css

==================================
typescript

makeTopScore -> type assertion! SPR





==================================

bugs:
kill hero sometimes appear in the wrong place

notes:

1. enums: are they needed here?
2. useState with arrays -> wrapper funcions??

to do:
DONE 3. better leaving to the side -> make it the same in moveHero & moveEnemies DONe
DONE no movement after kill DONE
DONE color for new enemy DONE
DONE enemies arrive at borders DONE
DONE color for just killed enemy DONE
DONE cleaning functions DONE
DONE clear wait? DONE 
DONE no chasing hero DONE
DONE dead animation on wrong tile DONE
XXX hero move & enemy move -> time difference?XXX
DONE corners not moveable to? plus styling DONE
XXX enemy won't arrive next to hero? XXX
XXX performance issues after many turns?XXX
DONE last turn should be also counted DONE
DONE localStorage custom hook? DONE
back in time custom hook?
DONE sometimes enemies disappear?? DONE (bug fixed)
DONE backspace -> move one turn back in time DONE
DONE smaller(px) board? DONE
DONE medal? 100 175 250 DONE
DONE change enemy render when near hero DONE
setting topScore not only on death?
Tile -> better code, too many "hidden" settings, new file for CSS objects?
round the hero div?
XXX better svg for waiting?XXX
svg sizes
delete enemies killed in MainUI
X new game confirmation? X
X controls -> light out when move not possible? X
DEV mode: Board -> div commented out
check if merriweather font works -> app title?
top score: change string to number type?
silver medal not visible enough?
different upper UI for big and small screens??
change UI from black to violet?
toggle large screen mode or toggle always on?
be default: green sound on icon?
UpperRightSettings children - too many props??
Touch * Keyboard btns -> save to localStorage?
enable clickin/touch on Medal?
change Help positioning if control buttons are visible in largeRenderMode - still not perfect
DONE !!! toggle setting after resizing down !!! DONE
make useMemo notes (Help)
make Help less wide??
UpperRightSettings big * small -> unify code somehow
red bg on sound icon when on
no display text on setting when on small screen
zapSplat acknowledgement (icons too??).
too many functions nested inside functions (moveHero-> moveEnemies...)
