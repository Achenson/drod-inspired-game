tailwind ccs && typescript:

1. npx create-react-app [name] -- typescript
2. npm i -D tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer
3. npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full (all settings will be visible) 
(for some reason has to be tailwind.js not tailwind.config.js!)
4. change tailwind.js name, so it won't work anymory, but all settings can be checked
5. npx tailwind init tailwind.js 
(this time without -- full flag -> in this file we will put only our custom settings)
6. postcss.config.js -> 

const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
module.exports = {
  plugins: [tailwindcss("./tailwind.js"), require("autoprefixer")],
};

7.  src/assets/main.css

    src/assets/tailwind.css
    @import "tailwindcss/base";
    @import "tailwindcss/components";
    @import "tailwindcss/utilities";

8. delete both .ccs file in root, delete react logo

9. package.json:

"start": "npm run watch:css && react-scripts start",
"build": "npm run build:css && react-scripts build",
   ...
"build:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css",
"watch:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css"

10. Tailwind css intelisense extension

11.  index.tsx 

    import './assets/main.css';

12. after every change in config file (tailwind.js) run npm run build:css
